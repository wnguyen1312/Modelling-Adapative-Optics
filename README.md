# Optical-Ray-Tracer

Date: 27/11/2022

By: William Nguyen

Written and tested in Python 3.7

----- GETTING STARTED -----

- import the classes and functions from the raytracer.py and optimisation.py

- set up an optical system, which can consist of SphericalRefraction, AsphericRefraction and OutputPlane objects 

- use propagate_ray method to trace rays or a collimated beam

- visualise the results with MatplotLib 

- For more detailed instruction, see example.py file 


----- MODULES -----

- raytracer.py contains the classes and functions required to model ray tracing

- optimisation.py contains the methods to calculate RMS of different optical systems  


----- SCRIPTS ------

- example.py contains the example script on how to get started with the optical ray tracer

- unit_test.py contains the script to check the operations of classes and functions

- aspheric_surface_testing contains the unit tests for aspheric surface. 

- ray_tracing_investigation.py contains the script to perform Task 12 - 15 of the project.

- biconvex_lens_optimisation.py contains the script to perform the lens optimisation task. 

- aspheric_surface_optimisation contains the script to optimise plano-convex and bi-convex lens with adaptive optics. 

----- Sample outputs ------
